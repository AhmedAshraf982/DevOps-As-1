        <p>
          Greetings, I am Ahmed, a Computer Science undergraduate student
          currently enrolled in FAST NUCES with a CGPA of 3.74. Throughout my
          academic journey, I have a passion for software development,
          particularly in web and desktop applications. I have extensive
          experience working with NodeJS, ExpressJS, ReactJS, JavaScript,
          Python, C#, and Java.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my academic journey, I have worked on several projects that
          involved developing web applications and desktop applications using
          these technologies. I have a solid understanding of the underlying
          concepts, such as data structures, algorithms, and design patterns,
          which I apply in my coding practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from my coursework, I have worked on side projects using Python,
          C#, and Java. These projects helped me gain practical experience in
          developing desktop applications, database modeling, and user interface
          design. I have also incorporated these technologies into my semester
          project, which involved developing a web application for a client.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my expertise in web development and desktop
          development, I am also proficient in Python, a versatile programming
          language that is widely used in data analysis, scientific computing,
          and machine learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my technical skills, I have developed strong
          communication and collaboration skills by working in teams. I am a
          quick learner and am always eager to explore new technologies and
          apply them to solve real-world problems.
